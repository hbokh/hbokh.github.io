Of course it’s not about Ubuntu but on the USENET-providers (with high retention!) that will give you free access to their newsgroups containing a huge amount of (semi) illegal content, not only pr0n, but also warez, ebooks, DivX-movies and the whole lot, as long as you connect over… IPv6! And since “The Pirate Bay” is having an IPv6-tracker but is in stormy waters, more and more people will turn to USENET for their “specific needs”.\nSo? It’s only a matter of time until the RIAA will find out about IPv6 and call for appropriate actions… In the meantime do whatever you think is right (or not). :-P\n",
